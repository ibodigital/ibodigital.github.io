# Manage Groups

trustkey supports user groups.  Users assigned to groups can be used for assignment to templates, action packs as well as sharing and even external access.

To create a group:

1. Navigate to the **Admin**
2. Select **Group Management**
3. Add New Group
4. Enter a group name and description
5. Add one or more members to this group.
6. Save



Changes to members of the group will also change their access rights to the respective Template, Action Packs and Knowledge Articles.

We recommend using groups for template ownership and creation of shared links to be used within external tools such as documents and ERP systems.
