# Profile Timetime

The timezone feature allows the current time/date to be adjusted to your local timezone. For example, Sue works in London and created an Action Pack at 8:00am.  As she is in London her local timezone is GMT.  George is in New York.  If George has his timezone also set at GMT he will also see that Sue created an action pack at 8.00am.  This can be somewhat confusing if the timezone adjustment is not taken into consideration.  Thefore, if George changes his timezone to New York (-5 hours GMT), then the time shown would be 3:00am.

To change the local timezone:

1. Select your profile image/icon
2. Select **User Profile**
3. Select the required Timezone
4. Save your changes
